## Project Description
This project implements a fully customizable neural network that can adjust its architecture (layers and neurons per layer) based on user input. The model is built entirely from scratch, without relying on major deep learning frameworks, showcasing a deep understanding of core neural network principles.

The project further employs the wild horse metaheuristic optimization to enhance model accuracy while optimizing the size and number of iterations, making it a novel approach in customizable neural networks.

## Features
- **Dynamic Architecture**: User-defined layer structure and neuron count per layer.
- **Wild Horse Optimization (WHO)**: Enhances model accuracy and efficiency through a custom metaheuristic algorithm.
- **Core Implementation**: Built entirely from scratch using only Python and basic libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.
